# vhd-projects

~*A series of electronic simulations written in VHDL for an electronics course.*

This repo contains various files written in VHDL for use with Altera's Quartus II software.
These projects would be simulated and tested on Terasic's DE0-nano development board, using the Cyclone IV E processor.


### //TODO

* Ensure each project is working + tidy up code.
* Include write-ups + images on each simulated device.
* Include config files(?) for Quartus II simulation and device useage.
